Does the server work?

Every test here runs with fake keys and no internet. That is deliberate:
these run on every push, in public, on a machine that is not yours. A test
that needs a real key is a test that cannot run safely in public.

WHAT WE ARE NOT TESTING
-----------------------
Whether the agent gives good answers. You cannot unit-test a model's words -
the same question can get two different replies and both be right. So we
test the plumbing: the server starts, the page is served, the procedures
load, bad input is refused. Whether the answers are any good is what
Langfuse is for, and that is a different week.

    "Support Console" anywhere in the page, and it stayed green when the
